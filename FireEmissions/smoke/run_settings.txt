# NOTES TO CONSIDER WHEN BUILDING THIS DATASET:
#   1) Temporal runs all days for each month in a single instance, so you
#      cannot use run_settings.txt to turn off only certain days in a month for 
#      Temporal. It's all or nothing, and is determined by whether the first 
#      representative day of the month is Y or N. 
#      Smkmerge/Movesmrg/Mrggrid can be turned off for individual days.
#   2) Entries do not need to be here for a "Yes", since the defaults in the
#      main run script are assumed to be "Yes".  However, including "Y" entries
#      will not hurt anything (except for Temporal, see #4).
#   3) Sector-specific "Y" entries will override Sector = "all" "N" entries 
#      for the same grid, program, part, and date range.
#   4) The bug where explicit Temporal=Y settings result in the Temporal outputs
#      being deleted as soon as they are created has been FIXED (as of 11/12/20).
#   5) The domain totals program ("domain") doesn't work for files larger than 2 GB. 
#      This only comes up when running 3-D emissions.
#
# On 26 May 2017, C. Allen edited all active run scripts to turn off PART2 Smkreport for good.
# So, we don't need to turn off PART2 Smkreport in here anymore.
